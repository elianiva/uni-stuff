        What is \texttt{\%s} is used for in this statement?
        \begin{minted}[autogobble, bgcolor=bg, fontsize=\scriptsize]{java}

        Are there any other symbols that can be used besides \texttt{\%s}? Mention and explain them!

        The \texttt{\%s} is one of the format specifier. It will be replaced by a variable when it gets executed.
        There are also other format that can be used for different data types. See the table below:

            \texttt{\%a} & float & Hex output of float\\
            \texttt{\%b} & any type & \texttt{true} if non-null, \texttt{false} if null\\
            \texttt{\%c} & character & Unicode character\\
            \texttt{\%d} & integer (byte, short, int, long) & Decimal integer\\
            \texttt{\%e} & floating point & Decimal number in scientific notation\\
            \texttt{\%f} & floating point number & Decimal number\\
            \texttt{\%g} & floating point & Decimal number, possibly in scientific notation\\
            \texttt{\%h} & any type & Hex String of value from \texttt{hashCode()} method\\
            \texttt{\%n} & none & Platform-specific line separator\\
            \texttt{\%o} & integer (byte, short, int, long) & Octal number\\
