                        \item River A continues to river D
                        \item From D has the option to E / F / G river. If you choose F or G then it is possibility that one river must be crossed more than once.
                            Then the river E was chosen
                        \item From E, proceed to the connected and have same direction river, river H

                            We'll choose F because choosing it will make the entire path simpler.

        A laundry service "Smile Laundry" has a fee rule like this one
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The fare for every 1 kg of clothing is Rp. 4,500
            \item If the customer washes clothes more than 10 kg, the customer will get a 5\% discount
        \end{itemize}
        Today, Laundry only has 4 customers, namely Ani, Budi, Bina, and Cita.
        Ani brought 4kg of clothes, Budi brought 15kg of clothes, Bina brought 2kg, and finally Cita brought 11kg.
        What did Smile Laundry think that day? Create the Algorithm!

        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}[t]{@{}>{\bfseries}l!{:}X}
            \details{Input}{Laundry price/kg, Ani clothes (4kg), Budi clothes (15kg), Bina clothes (2kg), and Cita clothes (11kg)}
            \details{Output}{The total price}
            \details{Other Data}{5\% discount every $>10kg$}
            \details{Process}{

                    \item {
                        Calculate each prices using multiplication. If amount $>10kg$ then apply the discount
                        \begin{align}
                            Ani &= 4 \times 4500 &=& \textbf{Rp.18.000,-}\\
                            Budi &= 15 \times 4500 - (5\%) = 67500 - 3375 &=& \textbf{Rp.64.125,-}\\
                            Bina &= 2 \times 4500 &=& \textbf{Rp.9.000,-}\\
                            Cita &= 11 \times 45000 - (5\%) = 49500 - 2475 &=& \textbf{Rp.47.025,-}
                        \end{align}
                    }
                    \item {
                        Sum the prices
                        \begin{align}
                            18000+64125+9000+47025 = \textbf{Rp.138.150,-}
                        \end{align}
                        So the total price is $\textbf{Rp.138.150,-}$
                    }

            }
