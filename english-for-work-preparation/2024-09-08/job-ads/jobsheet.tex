\section{Exercise 9: Why you should be accepted in that position}

The reason why I should be accepted in that position is because I have almost 3 years
of experience in frontend web development, specifically in React and all of its metaframeworks.
I worked on various projects, both proprietary and open-source. I worked daily with
Typescript and Javascript so it's safe to say that I'm proficient in both languages. 
I've implemented Progressive Web Apps in the past, used all of the tech stacks mentioned apart from MobX.
I have a bunch of personal projects that I can show as a portfolio.

I often write unit tests for my code and always strive to deliver the best user experience
for the users of the applications that I build. I have experience working with CI/CD pipelines
using Github action and Gitlab CI to streamline the deployment process. Other than that, I also
have experience working with Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify to deploy my applications
to the edge network so that the users can access the application faster.

I also experienced collaborating with other people both in open source environment and
in a professional setting. I always meet my deadline early and always strive to deliver
the best quality of work. I am also a fast learner and always willing to learn new things.
I don't mind working in a team or working independently, I can adapt to both situations.
I've been working remotely for the past 2 years so I'm used to working with people
without meeting them in person.

I'm also used to working with agile methodologies, specifically Scrum. I can
manage my time effectively and always communicate with my team members if I have any
problems or solutions to the problems that we face.

I believe that I can bring a lot of value to the team and the company if I'm accepted
in that position.
