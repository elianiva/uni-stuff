JNX expedition serves domestic and international shipments with the
following details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        For domestic shipments, if the weight of the goods is less than 5 kg then
        there is no charge, if the goods weigh 5-10 kg then a fee of IDR 165,000 is
        charged, and if the weight of the goods is more than 10 kg then a fee of
        IDR 375,000
    }
    \item {
        For international shipments, if the weight of the goods is less than 2 kg,
        there is no charge, if the weight of the goods is more than 2 kg, a fee of
        IDR 500,000 is charged.
    }
\end{itemize}

\section{Assignment 2}
The ATM system has 3 menus, namely Withdrawal, Transfer, and Change PIN
\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        On the Withdrawal menu, users are asked to select the type of savings
        “Giro” or “Deposito”, then enter the amount of money to be withdrawn
    }
    \item {
        On the Transfer menu, users are asked to select the destination bank code
        consisting of BRI, BNI, Mandiri, Bukopin, and BCA, then enter the
        destination account, and enter the amount of money to be transferred
    }
    \item {
        On the Change PIN menu, the user is asked to enter the old password and
        the new password

\section{Assignment 3}
Every Saturday, a clothing store gives a discount to its customers according to the
type of clothes and the number of clothes purchased
\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        A 10\% discount is given if the clothes purchased are jackets, then an additional
        2\% discount will be given if more than 2 clothes are purchased
    }
    \item {
        A discount of 7\% is given if the clothes purchased are shirts, then an additional
        2\% discount will be given if the clothes purchased are more than 3, whereas if
        the clothes purchased are less than or equal to 3, an additional 1\% discount will
        be given
    }
    \item {
        Customers will get a 5\% discount for clothes other than jackets and shirts if the
        clothes purchased are more than 3 products
    }
\end{itemize}
Make a flowchart to determine the total amount to be paid if the input is the type
and quantity of clothes (the price of each garment is determined by the system)!
