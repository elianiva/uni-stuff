\section*{Exercise}
\subsubsection*{Combination Problems Mathematical, Probability and Decision Trees}
There are two ways I go to work, both involve a two part journey.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I can cycle to the bus stop; it usually takes 5 minutes, or 15 minutes if the railroad crossing is closed on the road, which happens on 10\% of occasions.
    \item A bus takes an average of 5 minutes to arrive. I took the first bus, which may have been a slow bus that took 30 minutes or a fast bus that took 15 minutes. Chances of I get a slow bus is 20\%
    \item Or, I could drive to the Park and Ride parking lot
    \item Driving normally takes 15 minutes, but about half the time there is a traffic jam and it taks 20 minutes.
    \item When I get to the Park and Ride, sometimes I get the bus right away, but there's a 60\% chance I'll have to wait 10 minutes for the next bus.
    \item The bus took 10 minutes to take me to work.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        What is my shortest time to start to work?

        From the statements above, we can gather up these informations:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item {
                The First Route
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Cycle: 5 minutes
                    \item Bus: 0 minutes
                    \item Fast Bus: 15 minutes
                \end{itemize}
                \textbf{Total}: 20 minutes
                }
                \item {
                    The Second Route
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Drive: 15 minutes
                        \item Wait for a Bus: 0 minutes
                        \item Riding the Bus: 10 minutes
                    \end{itemize}
                \textbf{Total}: 25 minutes
            }
        \end{enumerate}
        Based on the data that we've summarised, the shorted path would be the first one because it only takes 20 minutes to travel.
    }
    \pagebreak
    \item {
        On average, what is my best option for going to work and how much time do I need?
    }
    \item {
        What is the probability that the first trip option takes 40 minutes or more?
    }
\end{enumerate}
