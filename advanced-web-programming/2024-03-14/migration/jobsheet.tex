\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 1 - Step 5}, what is the function of the \texttt{APP\_KEY} in the Laravel \texttt{.env} setting file?

        It is used to encrypt the session and other data in Laravel.
    }
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 1}, how do we generate value for \texttt{APP\_KEY}?

        We can generate the value for \texttt{APP\_KEY} by using the command \texttt{php artisan key:generate}.
    }
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 2.1 - Step 1}, by default how many migration files does Laravel have? and what are the migration files for?

        By default, Laravel has 4 migration files. The migration files are used to create users, password resets, failed jobs, and personal access tokens.
    }
    \item {
        By default, the migration file contains the code \texttt{\$table->timestamps();}, what is the purpose/output of the function?

        The function is used to create two columns, \texttt{created\_at} and \texttt{updated\_at}, which are used to store the date and time when the data was created and updated.
    }
    \item {
        In the Migration File, there is a function \texttt{\$table->id();} What type of data does the function return?

        The function returns an \texttt{unsigned big integer} data type.
    }
    \item {
        What is the difference between the migration results in the \texttt{m\_level} table, between using \texttt{\$table->id();} by using \texttt{\$table->id('level\_id');}?

        The difference is that the first one will create a column named \texttt{id} as the primary key, while the second one will create a column named \texttt{level\_id} as the primary key.
    }
    \item {
        In migrations, what is the \texttt{->unique()} function used for?

        The \texttt{->unique()} function is used to create a unique index on a column.
    }
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 2.2 - Step 2}, why does the \texttt{level\_id} column in the \texttt{m\_user} table use \texttt{\$table->unsignedBigInteger('level\_id')}, while the \texttt{level\_id} column in the \texttt{m\_level} table uses \texttt{\$table->id('level\_id')} ?

        The \texttt{\$table->unsignedBigInteger('level\_id')} is used to create a column named \texttt{level\_id} as a foreign key, while the \texttt{\$table->id('level\_id')} is used to create a column named \texttt{level\_id} as the primary key.
    }
    \pagebreak
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 3 - Step 6}, what is the purpose of the \texttt{Hash} Class? and what does the Hash program code mean \texttt{::make('1234');} ?

        The \texttt{Hash} class is used to hash the password. The \texttt{::make('1234')} code is used to hash the string \texttt{1234}.
    }
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 4 - Step 3/5/7}, in the query builder there is a question mark (?), what is the use of the question mark (?) of these?

        The question mark (?) is used as a placeholder for the value that will be passed to the query.
    }
    \item {
        In \textbf{Practicum 6 - Step 3}, what is the purpose of writing protected code \texttt{\$table = 'm\_user';} and protected \texttt{\$primaryKey = 'user\_id';} ?

        The \texttt{\$table} is used to define the table name, while the \texttt{\$primaryKey} is used to define the primary key of the table.
    }
    \item {
        In your opinion, where is it easier to use in performing CRUD operations to the database (DB Fa√ßade / Query Builder / Eloquent ORM) ?

        In my opinion, it is easier to use Eloquent ORM to perform CRUD operations to the database.
        But, it depends on the situation and the needs of the application.
        Most of the time I would much prefer the query builder because it's more maintainable in the long run and easier to debug.
        It doesn't involve a lot of magic and it's easier to understand what's going on.
